Matrix multiplication with mutexes

Steps to run the program:
- Put the multiplier.c file in the same folder as the matA.dat and matB.dat files
- Open the terminal and type the following command: ```gcc -o multiplier multiplier.c```
-Then type: ```./multiplier <numberOfBuffers>```

After that, the program will generate a new file called result.dat with the result of the matrix multiplication

*NOTE: matA and matB have a fixed size of 2000 x 2000
